# terraform\_practice



Here I train on building infrastructure etc. using Terraform.



I started building a S3 which also funtions as a backend for the state file.

Then I keep building:



VPC: default VPC



Subnets: 2 public subnets in different availability zones

Created 2 private subnets, 1 for app and 1 for database in 2 different AZs.



Route tables and associations for the private subnets and the public subnets
